# Connect5AI
This project is built with python and tensorflow and it's main objective is to train a model to play connect5 by @PeterKeDer.

It has been developed as the final project of @Pacutacatete100 and @aguilaair with the help of @fatcatmat.

This project is not finished yet and will not train. We hope to fix this soon.

@aguilaair and @fatcatmat when should we continue working on this?
            Aguilaair: I'm up for it whenever!
